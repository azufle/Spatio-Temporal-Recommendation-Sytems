\section{Spatio-Temporal User-Site Feature Extraction}
\label{sec:method}

There are many spatio-temporal features that could potentially be related to a user's feeling of a location. We discuss in the section a set of common features we select for the rating prediction problem, and the methods we use to extra such features. It is easy to understand why these features are select, given that they are quite intuitive.

\subsection{Extracting the frequency of visits of a user}

Our assumption is, if a user repeatedly visit a place, e.g., always dine in the same restaurant, it strongly suggests that the user would rate this place highly. On the other hand, if a user visits a place only once, then never comes back, it may be because the user dislike the place.

In order 

Average duration between visits
Minimal duration between visits
Maximal duration between visits
Multiple visits a day
at least one visit a day
at least one visit a week
at least one visit a month
Only one visit a month
Never visited

\subsection{Extracting the length of stays of a user}


\subsection{Extracting the travel distance of a user from its home base}

Food, Mall, etc. Not hotel
Show a figure/do location clustering


\subsection{Extracting the total number of different visitors}


\subsection{Extracting the type of location}


\subsection{Discussion}
1. Assumptions
2. Lack of data: Pattern emerges only if data accumulate
3. Explore social connection
4. Explore comparability of nearby PoIs
