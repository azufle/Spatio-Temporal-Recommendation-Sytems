\section{Spatio-Temporal User-Site Feature Extraction}
\label{sec:method}

There are many spatio-temporal features that could potentially be related to a user's feeling of a location. We discuss in the section a set of common features we select for the rating prediction problem, and the methods we use to extra such features. It is easy to understand why these features are selected since they are intuitive.

\subsection{Extracting the frequency of visits of a user}

Our assumption is, if a user repeatedly visits a PoI, e.g., always dine in the same restaurant, it strongly suggests that the user favours the PoI. On the other hand, if a user visits a PoI only once and never comes back, it suggests the user dislike the place. Therefore we choose the frequency of visits as a feature. Here, each stay-point is considered a visit.

In order to extra frequency information from a user's trajectories, we count for how many time does the user visit a location in a given time period. Typically, each check-in to the location is counted as one visit. Users are then assigned into several frequency groups (Table~\ref{frequencyGroups}) based on how often they visit the location. Note that if a user has never visited a PoI, he cannot rate it. Thus we do not assign any group for such users.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Groups based on how often user visits a location \label{frequencyGroups}}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
\textbf{Frequency groups} \\ \hline
At least one visit per day \\ \hline
At least one visit per week \\ \hline
At least one visit per month \\ \hline
Less than one visit per month \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

We note a user's behaviour may vary over time. For example, if a user likes a shopping center, he may visit the shopping center very frequently during Thanksgiving and similar holidays, while visit the same place only once in several month during the rest of the year. As a result, the timing window used to count visits can have significant impact on the user's group assignment. For the same user, if we consider only visits happened in the Thanksgiving week, the user belongs to the ``At least one visit per week " group. However, if we look at the year-long visits, he may be grouped into ``Less than one visit per month" since his visits are averaged over twelve months. We propose a simple way to mitigate this problem.

First, we use timing windows with different sizes simultaneously to compute the frequency of visits of a user. Specifically, given a user's trajectory data for a period of $n$ days, for each day/week/month within these $n$ days, we count the number of visits that falls in the same day/week/month. We then use this count to compute the user's group of that specific day/week/month. Here we use day/week/month as nature timing windows, but in practice the size of timing window can be arbitrary. Second, when a user's visit frequency demonstrates inconsistency in different time period with the same timing window size, we use his maximal visiting frequency, e.g., if a user visits a location 3 times a week in week 1, but 0 times in week 2, the user is then categorized as ``At least one visit per week" in this case. Given that each user has a unique and consistent ID, for each PoI, we can then calculate how many users falls in each frequency group.

Additionally, for each PoI, we calculate three numerical features that also describe the users' visiting pattern to the PoI: 1) \textbf{Average duration between two consecutive visits of a user}, 2) \textbf{Minimal duration between two consecutive visits of a user}, and 3) \textbf{Maximal duration between two consecutive visits of a user}. These information are supplemental to the frequency groups. We are interested in finding out their impact on the rating prediction result.

\subsection{Extracting the length of stays of a user}

Given a trajectory dataset, the length of stays can be inferred by examining the interval between consecutive check-ins of the user. If two visits are reported within a time threshold $\tau$, e.g., 30-minutes, it is safe to consider the two check-ins belong to the same stay. Thus, the minimal length of this stay is the time frame between the two check-ins. Similarly, an upper bound of the length of stay is the time between a check-in to the location and the closest check-in to a different location. This provides us with a coarse way to estimate the average length of stay of users to a PoI. This method is most accurate if the user's location is reported periodically with small intervals, or whenever the user changes location.

\subsection{Extracting the travel distance of a user from its home base}

If a user is willing to travel a long distance from his home/work area to a PoI, it is likely that the PoI is attractive to him. Unfortunately, measuring the travel distance from one's home/work can be challenging. This is because users' home or work address or coordinates are usually not explicitly marked in a spatial-temporal dataset due to privacy concerns.

We use distance-based location clustering (e.g., weighted k-means~\cite{kerdprasop2005weighted}, where the weight of a location is the number of visits by the user) to estimate a user's home base, i.e., an area where he is likely to live/work. Locations a user visits frequently is likely to formulate a dense cluster in the area where he lives and works~\cite{golle2009anonymity, zang2011anonymization}. If there exists a location that is isolated from any of these clusters, we deem such a location as ``far from home". It requires extra effort for the user to travel this location. Willing to make such effort indicates the user may like the place. An example of home base and isolated locations is illustrated in Figure~\ref{example}.

\end{figure}

For each isolated location, we estimate the travelling effort for the user to reach the location. Using the distance between the isolated location and the user's home base may be biased. A user who likes to drive can easily travel to a mall several miles away from home, but for someone who does not have a car, travelling the same distance means significantly more effort. Instead, we use the relative travelling distance. For a location $l$, we compute $D_l = d_l / \overline{d_{home}}$ where $d_l$ is the minimal travel distance between $l$ and any home base location, and $\overline{d_{home}}$ the average travel distance between locations within the user's home base.

\subsection{Extracting the type of PoI}

A user's spatial-temporal behaviour can be very different in different types of PoIs. Suppose a user gives high rate for both a coffee stand and a theatre. It is common for a user to visit the coffee stand every day or even multiple times a day, while such a visiting pattern is not likely to appear for his visiting to the theatre. Given the diversity of locations, we believe the type of different PoIs serves as an important feature in the rating prediction process.

Fortunately, in many spatial-temporal datasets (e.g., \cite{yang2014modeling}), a category is given for each PoI. Nevertheless, a dataset may provide only coordinate of visited locations with no additional information. One way to infer the type of PoI in this case is to match the coordinates to PoIs using geoinfo systems such as Google Map, which provides detailed category information of PoIs.


\subsection{Discussion}

Due to limited space, we briefly discuss some other features that could be explored for user rating prediction.
