\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:exp}

We evaluate the proposed technique over the FourSquare check-in dataset~\cite{yang2014modeling}. The dataset contains 227,428 check-ins in New York city and 573,703 check-ins in Tokyo collected in a duration of 10 month. 

For comparison purpose, we have implemented three schemes:
\begin{itemize}

\item{Linear regression} A baseline approach that predicts user ratings with a model generated by simple linear regression with the proposed features.

\item{Matrix Factorization} The standard non-negative matrix factorization~\cite{koren2009matrix} for recommender systems. We use matrix factorization to predict the average rating of all the users who have visited a PoI.

\end{itemize}
